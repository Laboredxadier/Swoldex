        name: "Himbrr",
        overview: `Boasting incredible HP and M Def stats, Himbrr serves as the premiere Icicle Trapper within the current meta. With an unresisted STAB combination supplemented by Awakening, it is able to deal significant damage to a majority of opposing Loomians while still being able to take attacks from nukes such as Trumbull, Zuelong, and Boarrok. With an Ice / Earth typing, Himbrr can threaten Loomians with hazard removal such as Eruptidon and Avitross. Despite these perks, Himbrr's lack of recovery options leaves it vulnerable to being worn down by opposing attacks or status as a game progresses.`,
        sets: [
            {
                setName: "Bulky Icicle Trapper",

                detail: `Max TP investment in HP and R Def alongside a Clever personality allows for maximum protection against ranged attackers. 200 HP with 100 M Def and a Robust personality prevents Himbrr from being 3HKOd by Brawny Power Cuffs Searknight. Health Amulet aids Himbrr with consistent recovery that scales well with it’s high HP stat, a tool Himbrr does not have access to otherwise. Health Amulet is a huge boost to Himbrr's kit, and losing it could cost its user greatly. Despite Ice / Earth STAB hitting the majority of the meta for super-effective damage, Himbrr lacks a high M Atk stat and encourages relatively safe entry from Loomians such as Defensive Vesperatu, Chartiki, and Luminami. Other threats may simply predict and punish Himbrr for selecting a resisted STAB when switching in such as Tahtab and Searknight. Quicksand allows for Himbrr to reliably beat opposing Himbrrs, Trumbull, and potentially R Def variants of Sedimars.`
            }
        ],
        teamOptions: `Himbrr appreciates teammates that benefit from its bulkiness and Icicle Trap damage. Avitross has the ability to threaten and even check Brawler Types while nuking Fire Types such as Eruptidon and Krakaloa. Additionally, Himbrr switches into the likes of Zuelong and Eleguana for Avitross. Tiklipse serves as a Slap Down absorber and benefits from Icicle Traps breaking down the Plant Types that are immune to it’s Gloominous Roar. Wonder Herb users such as Gobbidemic, Florant, Wiki-Wiki, and Gastroak all are effective at serving as clerics erasing the crippling poisons and burns that would typically be the end for Himbrr. The likes of Krakaloa and Ikazune are able to switch into an incoming fire nuke and absorb the attack for Himbrr. It’s for this reason that Chartiki is also able to come into a Tahtab, anticipating a Life Drain and boosting it’s own Plant STAB.`,
        checksAndCounters: `<b>Chip:</b> Himbrr has no form of recovery outside of Health Amulet making it vulnerable to chip damage. Himbrr is also susceptible to being Poisoned or Burned, neutralizing Health Amulet recovery and, if burned, greatly decreasing Himbrr’s damage output. Consequently, Poison Barbs largely affects Himbrr’s longevity.
 
        <br><br><b>Water Types:</b> Luminami and Ventacean excel at taking hits from Himbrr and threatening it with more damage in return. Luminami is able to heal off any damage done by Himbrr easily with Rejuvenate or Power Napper while wearing down Himbrr with super effective STAB. Luminami is further able to create momentum for it’s own team via Flash and Flee on the switch-in. Ventacean threatens a 30% burn from Geyser and disregards Himbrrs attempts to break through its monstrous 142 M Def stat.
         
        <br><br><b>Fire Types:</b> Despite being weak to Earth, many Fire Loomians are capable of nuking Himbrr with huge damage such as Eruptidon, Ikazune, and Revinine. Chartiki, Searknight, and Krakaloa even have the bulk to take Earthquakes from Himbrr. Additionally, Fire Loomians have the ability to pressure Himbrr by burning Icicle Traps when switching in.
         
        <br><br><b>Brawler Types:</b> Tahtab has the offensive power to 2HKO Himbrr when using Power Cuffs and a Brawny personality. It can easily whittle down Himbrr with a mixed attacking set, healing off any damage it may have taken with Life Drain. Ursoul threatens to remove Himbrr’s Health Amulet with slap down and whittles it down with Quick Punches.`,
